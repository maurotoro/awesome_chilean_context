# Environmental conflicts in Chile

Some examples of environmental conflicts in the country:

  * Chile is the only country in the world that has private ownership of it's water. The *water code* (Código de Aguas), imposed under dictatorship, establishes that a owner has rights of use, including renting, buying and selling those rights as with any other property [REF](https://www.leychile.cl/Navegar?idNorma=5605).

  * Up to the year 2012, 90% of the rights to use consumptive water (water that will not go back to the river flow) is on hands of mining and agro companies, while almost 100% of the non consumptive is at hands of multinational companies, such as ENDESA [REF](https://ciperchile.cl/2012/02/17/la-privatizacion-de-las-aguas-en-chile-viola-los-derechos-humanos/).

  * During 2015, 110of the watersheds in the country have a demand that exceeds their natural recharge, therefore water rights have been over-granted [REF](https://www.interior.gob.cl/media/2015/04/recursos_hidricos.pdf).

  * At 2015, a situation of water scarcity is experienced in 13 of the 15 regions of the country. Where, approximately 400,000 people receive drinking water through tank trucks [REF](https://www.interior.gob.cl/media/2015/04/recursos_hidricos.pdf).

  * The National Institute of Human Rights (INDH) notes that of the 116 socio-environmental conflicts existing in Chile at 2015, 38% are due to the energy production sector [REF](mapaconflictos.indh.cl). In spite of this, a total of 114 electricity generation projects are currently counted as in construction [REF](mapaconflictos.indh.cl).

  * The National Energy Commission (CNE) estimates that by 2018 Chile has an installed power generation capacity of 23,315 MW, with the national the maximum energetic demand is estimated at 10,529 MW [REF](https://www.cne.cl/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Anuario-CNE-2018.pdf). Despite this, a total of 114 power generation projects are currently under construction [REF](https://mapaconflictos.indh.cl).


  * In the year 2016, there where five zones fo environmental sacrifice throughout the national territory (Tocopilla, Mejillones, Huasco, Puchuncaví-Quintero, Colonel). These are territories of human setlement environmentally devastated by industrial development, directly violating people's fundamental rights (right to life, health, education, work, food, housing, etc) [REF](https://www.terram.cl/2016/02/infografias-conoce-las-zonas-de-sacrificio-ambiental-del-pais-2/).

  * These zones fo environmental sacrifice concentrate the 28 (100%) of the carbon based thermoelectric power stations of Chile [REF](https://www.eldesconcierto.cl/2018/10/03/zonas-de-sacrificio-las-6-comunas-que-concentran-las-28-termoelectricas-a-carbon-en-chile/).

  * At the Latin American level, the [Latin America Observatory of Mining Conflict](https://www.ocmal.org/) (Observatorio de Conflictos Mineros de America Latina), generated a map of 266 mining conflicts [REF](https://mapa.conflictosmineros.net), with a total of 49 conflicts associated with Chile [REF](https://mapa.conflictosmineros.net/ocmal_db-v2/conflicto/list/02032300) the country with the most conflicts in the list.

# Conflicts in relation to Piñera governments

President Sebastián Piñera canceled the meeting of the COP25 to be held in Chile after a letter signed by more than 40 MEPs repudiating the severe represion and human rights violations during the protests of the Chilean people [REF](https://twitter.com/leilachaibi/status/1189182854191706115).

However, even thought it is now taking place in Madrid [REF](https://www.cop25.cl), it will still be leaded by Carolina Schmidt, the Chilean Minister for the Environment [REF](https://www.cop25.cl/#/equipo-y-presidencia).

The following are a list of some conflicts of interest between the government and the environment. Some of them are historical cases, which allow us to understand that this government and its accomplices have an extractivist view of the ecosystem, where the world is a bag of resources to be exploited.

## Oxiquim

Oxiquim is one of the companies responsible for the toxic gas cloud that led more than 300 people to be hospitalized in the area of ​​Quinteros and Puchuncaví [REF](http://olca.cl/articulo/nota.php?id=107406).

Oxiquim is a company associated with Piñera by its general director, lawyer Fernando Barros, who has been representative of the president in different cases related to his fiscal abuses, in addition he is one of the architects behind the strategy of tax evasion through «zombie companies» [REF](https://www.eldinamo.cl/nacional/2017/11/03/fernando-barros-el-tributarista-que-ayudo-a-eludir-millonarios-impuestos-a-pinera-y-leonidas-vial/). In addition to this direct link with the president, the lawyer and general director of the Oxiquim was a shared the same lawyers buffet for 20 years with the husband of the former interior minister and current minister of the environment, Carolina Schmidt [REF](https://www.elmostrador.cl/noticias/pais/2018/08/29/el-precario-equilibrio-de-carolina-schmidt-tras-su-gestion-en-la-crisis-ambiental-de-quintero).

## Alto maipo

The Alto Maipo project seeks to build two pass-through hydroelectric plants in the upper Maipo River sector. Located in the Cajon del Maipo, the river, the El Yeso reservoir and Laguna Negra are part of the main water sources for the metropolitan region. The electrical project will inevitably affect the quality and quantity of crystalline waters that can be consumed [REF](https://laderasur.com/articulo/por-que-el-proyecto-alto-maipo-amenaza-la-provision-de-agua-potable-para-la-ciudad-de-santiago/). In addition to putting at risk various glaciers in the area and not having an environmental impact assessment according to the level of damage that represents [REF](https://biblioteca.sernageomin.cl/opac/datafiles/14905_v3_pp_349_351.pdf).

The project has as main investors AES-Gener (60%) z [INFO](https://www.eldesconcierto.cl/etiqueta/aes-gener/), where members of Piñera's cabinets have historically worked as the minister of energy and mining Laurence Golborne, and Antofagasta Minerals (40%), part of the Luksic group from the billionaire family of Andrónico Luksic [REF](www.poderopedia.org/cl/empresas/Alto_Maipo#tab_perfil).

## Isla Riesco

Minera Isla Riesco, is made up of shareholders of Copec and investors of Ultraterra Ltda to extract mineral coal in Chilean Patagonia. The ore will be sold to thermoelectric plants such as the central Guacolda SA. associated with AES-Gener to produce electricity that will power the central interconnected system. By 2011 Piñera is one of the largest individual shareholders of the Copec company, also members of his cabinet Laurence Golborne and Felipe Larrain had interests in the companies in which they previously worked, AES-Gener and COPEC respectively [REF](https://web.archive.org/web/20131103115027/http://www.cambio21.cl/cambio21/site/artic/20110719/pags/20110719194602.html).

The operations of this mine have involved irreparable damage to the local ecosystem, as well as various damages to archaeological heritage. All this product of bidding processes with little transparency and markedly irregular negotiations [REF](https://www.theclinic.cl/2019/07/03/isla-riesco-y-minera-invierno-todo-lo-que-necesitas-saber-para-comprender-el-conflicto/).

## Tantauco Park

Land belonging to Williches communities, which they have been under their control since 1826 when they sign the treaty of Tantauco, are appropriated by the state irregularly during the beginning of the twentieth century and since then they begin to be sold or tendered to private. In 2004 Piñera buys 115k hectares of native forest on the great island of Chiloe, about 15% of the island, from US investor Jeremiah Henderson who had bought the land for logging [REF](http://www.movimientodefendamoschiloe.cl/web/2017/06/07/como-pinera-se-compro/).

Although the project has been presented as a work of conservation and environmental protection, the truth is that the Williches communities have been displaced and stripped of their territories [REF](http://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/3f1b41_1a9c992fbc0942b4af51940076d8f0de.pdf?fbclid=IwAR1rrZmuht-beQDQqY8Lrh0PjDDKcPyB-qWmwhRc32cXYDrE1z8MMCxA4uU_.)

In addition to the serious aggression against the communities and their history, the colonialist delegitimization in the purchase action and false promises of compensation. Perhaps the political and poetic act of putting the name Tantauco, the name of the treaty that granted the Williche communities the recognition of the ownership of their lands before the new Chilean state, is the affront that makes clear the disinterest and cruel sense of humor of the President [REF](https://es.wikisource.org/wiki/Tratado_de_Tantauco).

## Dominga Mine

Four days after the first mandate of Piñera, Fondo Inversión Privado (FIP) mediterráneo, managed by Bancorp, part of the Bancard group, the investment group based in the British Virgin Islands of the Piñera-Morel family, created the society Minera Activa Uno [REF](https://www.elmostrador.cl/noticias/pais/2017/02/27/pinera-y-su-familia-tenia-intereses-en-minera-dominga-cuando-negocio-bajada-de-central-termoelectrica-barrancones/), it acquires various mining concessions in the commune of La Higuera in the Coquimbo Region, preparing the land for the exploitation of the existing Iron and Copper deposits in the area. While his family was preparing this business, as president, Piñera shuts down the Barrancones thermoelectric project, to be carried out near the area, under the pretext of protecting natural reserves, even though it was already approved by the environmental authorities of the time and forces them to look for a new location. The level of environmental impact of both projects in the area would not have allowed the mining project to be accepted, going as an independent would have greater possibilities [REF](https://www.biobiochile.cl/noticias/nacional/chile/2017/02/27/los-desconocidos-intereses-de-la-familia-pinera-en-minera-dominga.shtml).

The mining project threatens an area of ​​high ecological diversity, underestimates the area of ​​influence of its work that will profoundly impact the natural habitat of the Humboldt penguin, a species currently threatened [REF](https://alianzahumboldt.cl/). In addition to putting the surrounding natural sanctuaries at risk, given the level of possible damage to the environment, the mining project and its associated port can lead La Higuera to become a new zone of environmental ​​sacrifice [REF](https://ciperchile.cl/2019/03/07/proyecto-dominga-en-la-corte-suprema-dias-decisivos-para-la-biodiversidad-de-la-higuera/).

## Exalmar (Perú)

One of the most important fishing companies in Peru. It is mainly dedicated to extractive fishing, and fishmeal and fish-oil generation. In 2012, during his first term and in the midst of an international dispute over the marine border limits between Chile and Peru, one of the companies associated with Piñera's family purchased 9% of the company's shares [REF](https://www.biobiochile.cl/especial/noticias/reportajes/reportajes-reportajes/2016/11/14/los-negocios-que-pinera-hizo-en-el-mar-peruano-durante-el-juicio-de-la-haya.shtml).

Trawling is one of the biggest predators of marine ecosystems, the company has become the fourth fishing power in Peru thanks to its efficiency in the abuse of the marine environment. In addition, the trial before the international court allowed Piñera to increase the exploitation space of the fishing companies in which it has a stake in Peru. One of the readings on this participation is related to the way in which industrial fishing is regulated in Chile, which through the so-called Longueira Law leaves maritime resources in the hands of 7 families would not allow you to enter this lucrative market  [REF](https://www.elquintopoder.cl/medio-ambiente/el-legado-pesquero-de-sebastian-pinera/).

The Exalmar Chimobote plant has been heavily questioned for its role in noise pollution and air pollution in this area. In 2018, after strong pressures from social movements, its energy matrix from coal to natural gas had to be updated [REF](https://foronda.pe/pesquera-exalmar-presentara-plan-de-cambio-de-matriz-energetica-en-tres-semanas/).

In addition to its ecological abuses, the fishing industry is widely questioned for its political practices and its lack of retribution to the state whose resources it abuses. For example, on average, companies pays on average 4 USD per ton of anchovy extracted [REF](https://ojo-publico.com/480/la-concentracion-del-circulo-pesquero-en-el-peru).

## Costanera Plant (Argentina)

Through Bancard, it buys the Costanera plant in Argentina in 2004 in the midst of the crisis in the neighboring country [REF](https://www.cronista.com/impresageneral/Confirman-la-venta-de-Central-Costanera-20040326-0027.html). This is one of the largest pollutants in Argentina and has been accused of filtering hydrocarbons in an illegal manner to the Río de la Plata [REF]REF](https://www.ambito.com/sorpresivo-allanamiento-la-central-termica-costanera-sur-una-denuncia-contaminacion-n3645782).

During the almost four years in which he participates through Bancard and with the representation of his brother, Pablo Piñera, as the head of the plant, they become owners of 70% of the company's shares. Which they sold in 2007 to Endesa Chile. At the beginning of his current term, Sebastían tries to put his brother Pablo, as ambassador to Argentina, generating a brief conflict with the opposition political forces [REF](https://ciperchile.cl/2018/04/25/termoelectrica-costanera-la-breve-y-rentable-escala-de-los-hermanos-pinera-en-argentina/).
