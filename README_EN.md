# A little bit of context for the discontent

With all the people who would like to help, we've been making a list with examples showing the roots of the current problem in Chile.

I'm pasting it here and I hope that people could help me sending more data and their sources or translating.

### Press doesn't work, unless it's a report from a research centre,and wikipedia only when it's about judicial cases, wikimedia or similar.

# **Contextualization of the manifestations**:


* Until September 2019 the poverty line for a four-member family is $436,000 (CLP, 614 USD) [REF](http://observatorio.ministeriodesarrollosocial.gob.cl/layout/doc/ipc/Valor_CBA_y_LPs_19.09.pdf), while almost 50% of the population earning less than $400,000 (CLP, 536 USD) [REF](http://www.fundacionsol.cl/estudios/losverdaderos-salarios-de-chile-2018/). [2]

    * Taking this into account, a cis-hetero family with 2 children, in which both parents work and earn the populations' median salaries of  last August 2019. The mother would earn $343,234 (CLP, 483 USD) and the father would earn $411,100 (CLP, 579 USD); it is so that an average vagina is paid  16.5% less than an average penis. The total family income would be $754,334 (CLP, 445 USD), substracting the poverty line puts them $316,000 (CLP, 445 USD) above the current minimum wage ($301,000 CLP, 423 USD) [REF](https://ine.cl/prensa/detalle-prensa/2019/08/13/ingreso-laboral-promedio-mensual-en-chile-fue-de-$573.964-en-2018).[2]

* According to the CASEN survey from 2017, after spliting the population in deciles. Only since the 8th decile the average autonomous income per capita surpasses the current minimum wage [REF](http://observatorio.ministeriodesarrollosocial.gob.cl/casen-multidimensional/casen/casen_2017.php).

* Currently in 2019 the country's external debt is equal to the 67% of the GBP [REF](https://www.bcentral.cl/deuda-externa).

* Within the countries in the OECD, Chile is the country with the highest obesity index [REF](https://data.oecd.org/chart/5ILm).

* Mental health is a serious problem. In 2007 the WHO estimated that 31% of the population have had a psychiatric illness, however it is also estimated that about 60% of them was not treated [REF](https://www.who.int/mental_health/policy/country/chile/en/).

* Until 2012 UNICEF estimated that 50% of children have been victims of physical violence[REF](https://unicef.cl/web/tabla-5-indicadores-para-la-dimension-proteccion/).

* Currently in 2019 the highest income to Chile's economy is the related to copper mining [REF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Chile#/media/File:Tree_map_export_2009_Chile.jpeg). Since the ’90 the military receives 10% for the total income of state-owned copper companies (CODELCO). This money has been spent in casinos, horse racing, among others[REF](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milicogate).

* Historically the mining industry has been a way of stealing from the country's wealth. The World Bank reports that in the case of the Disputada mine, while it was under Exxon's administration for 24 year (1978-2002), it produced more than 3 millions tons of copper, without paying a cent in taxes during that period. [REF](https://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTOGMC/Resources/336099-1156955107170/miningroyaltiespublication.pdf).

* In the same period 1990-2018 the gross per capita income grew at a rate of 377 USD per year, while the minimal wage grew only at a rate of 8 [REF](https://data.worldbank.org/country/chile). [1][2]

* In 2017 33% of the country's wealth is owned by 1% of the population [REF](http://www.fundacionsol.cl/2017/07/banco-central-quintil-mas-rico-concentra-72-la-riqueza-chile/)

* In 2018 the Bahamas, Bermuda, Caiman Islands, the British Virgin Islands and Panama (countries known to be tax heavens) receive 33% of the direct active foreign investment, that is, the investments that leave Chile and enter an foreign country. [REF](https://si3.bcentral.cl/estadisticas/Principal1/Estudios/SE/BDP/IED.html).

* In 2019 the pension system for civilians currently provides an average of 310,000 (CLP, 436 USD), while the average for the military pensioneers is the double and even six-fold more. When the system changed (via privatization in the 80's) the pension system for the military stayed the same, it did not privatize. [REF](http://www.fundacionsol.cl/estudios/pensiones-por-la-fuerza-2019/). [2]

* Historically Chile has been one of the most unequal countries in the world, challenging Mexico for the sad last place in the ranking among OCDE counties [REF](https://data.oecd.org/chart/5Ivh).

* In the 2017 Human Development Index  Chile ranks 44th in the world, the 4th worse for OECD countries [REF](http://hdr.undp.org/en/data) [Resumen de Chile](http://hdr.undp.org/en/countries/profiles/CHL).

* In 2019 the wage for Chilean teachers is below the average for OECD countries [REF](https://data.oecd.org/teachers/teachers-salaries.htm), while Chile ranks among the 5 countries with the highest number of students per teacher [REF](https://data.oecd.org/chart/5IGj).

* In 2015 PISA tests Chile is on the third worse place in math [REF](https://data.oecd.org/chart/5IGk), 4th worse in science  [REF](https://data.oecd.org/chart/5IGm) and 5th worse in reading comprehension [REF](https://data.oecd.org/chart/5IKW), among the 35 OECD countries.

* In 2015 the results of the PISA tests in science are highly correlated with the student's socio-economic status, when compared against other countries. We rank 9th for the highest distance between rich and poor students [REF](http://gpseducation.oecd.org/CountryProfile?primaryCountry=CHL&treshold=10&topic=PI).

* In 2015 PISA tests show that Chileans schools have one the highest correlations between socio-economic status among students. That means that in the classroom students have basically the same socio-economic status. It can be also said that Chile is one of the countries with more social segregation in schools, ranking as one of the worse 3. [REF](http://gpseducation.oecd.org/CountryProfile?primaryCountry=CHL&treshold=10&topic=PI).

* Chile is the only country in the world that has private ownership of it's water. The *water code* (Código de Aguas), imposed under dictatorship, establishes that a owner has rights of use, including renting, buying and selling those rights as with any other property [REF](https://www.leychile.cl/Navegar?idNorma=5605).

* Up to the year 2012, 90% of the rights to use consumptive water (water that will not go back to the river flow) is on hands of mining and agro companies, while almost 100% of the non consumptive is at hands of multinational companies, such as ENDESA [REF](https://ciperchile.cl/2012/02/17/la-privatizacion-de-las-aguas-en-chile-viola-los-derechos-humanos/).

* During 2015, 110of the watersheds in the country have a demand that exceeds their natural recharge, therefore water rights have been over-granted [REF](https://www.interior.gob.cl/media/2015/04/recursos_hidricos.pdf).

* At 2015, a situation of water scarcity is experienced in 13 of the 15 regions of the country. Where, approximately 400,000 people receive drinking water through tank trucks [REF](https://www.interior.gob.cl/media/2015/04/recursos_hidricos.pdf).

* The National Institute of Human Rights (INDH) notes that of the 116 socio-environmental conflicts existing in Chile at 2015, 38% are due to the energy production sector [REF](mapaconflictos.indh.cl). In spite of this, a total of 114 electricity generation projects are currently counted as in construction [REF](mapaconflictos.indh.cl).

* The National Energy Commission (CNE) estimates that by 2018 Chile has an installed power generation capacity of 23,315 MW, with the national the maximum energetic demand is estimated at 10,529 MW [REF] (https://www.cne.cl/wp-content /uploads/2019/04/Anuario-CNE-2018.pdf). Despite this, a total of 114 power generation projects are currently under construction [REF] (https://mapaconflictos.indh.cl).

* In the year 2016, there where five zones fo environmental sacrifice throughout the national territory (Tocopilla, Mejillones, Huasco, Puchuncaví-Quintero, Colonel). These are territories of human setlement environmentally devastated by industrial development, directly violating people's fundamental rights (right to life, health, education, work, food, housing, etc) [REF](https://www.terram.cl/2016/02/infografias-conoce-las-zonas-de-sacrificio-ambiental-del-pais-2/).
