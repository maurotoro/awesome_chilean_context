# A little bit of context for the discontent

Since a while I've been making a list with examples showing the roots of the current problem in Chile. I'm pasting it here, I hope that people could help me sending more data and their sources. Press and wikipedia does not count, only when it's about judicial cases or similar.


Hugs and **el que no marcha es Piñera**.


* Until September 2019 the poverty line for a four-member family is $436,000 (CLP) [REF](http://observatorio.ministeriodesarrollosocial.gob.cl/layout/doc/ipc/Valor_CBA_y_LPs_19.09.pdf), while almost 50% of the population earning less than $400,000 [REF](http://www.fundacionsol.cl/estudios/losverdaderos-salarios-de-chile-2018/).

* Let's calculate the earnings of a cis-heterosexual family with 2 children, in which both parents work and earn the populations' median salaries of  last August 2019. The mother would earn $343,234 (CLP) and the father would earn $411,100; it is so that an average vagina is paid  16.5% less than an average penis. The total family income would be $754,334 CLP, which puts them  $316000 above the minimal wage ($301,000) [REF](https://ine.cl/prensa/detalle-prensa/2019/08/13/ingreso-laboral-promedio-mensual-en-chile-fue-de-$573.964-en-2018).

* Currently in 2019 the country's external debt is equal to the 67% of the GBP [REF](https://www.bcentral.cl/deuda-externa).

* Mental health is a serious problem. In 2007 the WHO estimated that 31% of the population have had a psychiatric illness, however it is also estimated that about 60% of them was not treated [REF](https://www.who.int/mental_health/policy/country/chile/en/).

* Until 2012 UNICEF estimated that 50% of children have been victims of physical violence[REF](https://unicef.cl/web/tabla-5-indicadores-para-la-dimension-proteccion/).

* Currenly in 2019 the highest income to Chile's economy is the related to copper mining [REF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Chile#/media/File:Tree_map_export_2009_Chile.jpeg). Since the ’90 the military receives 10% fo the total income of state-owned copper companies (CODELCO). This money has been spent in casinos, horse racing, among others[REF](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milicogate).

* Historically the mining industry has been a way of stealing from the country's wealth. The World Bank reports that in the case of the Disputada mine, while it was under Exxon's administration for 24 year (1978-2002), it produced more than 3 millions tons of cupper, without paying a cent in taxes during that period. [REF](https://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTOGMC/Resources/336099-1156955107170/miningroyaltiespublication.pdf).

* In the same period 1990-2018 the gross per capita income grew at a rate of 377 USD per year, while the minimal wage grew only at a rate of 8 [REF](https://data.worldbank.org/country/chile). [1]

* In 2017 33% of the country's wealth is owned by 1% of the population [REF](http://www.fundacionsol.cl/2017/07/banco-central-quintil-mas-rico-concentra-72-la-riqueza-chile/)

* In 2018 the Bahamas, Bermuda, Caiman Islands, the British Virgin Islands and Panamá (countries known to be tax heavens) receive 33% of the direct active foreign investment, that is, the investments that leave Chile and enter an foreign country. [REF](https://si3.bcentral.cl/estadisticas/Principal1/Estudios/SE/BDP/IED.html).

* In 2019 the pension system for civilians currently provides an average of 310,000 CLP, while the average for the military pensioneers is the double and even six-fold more. When the system changed (via privatization in the 80's) the pension system for the military stayed the same, it did not privatize. [REF](http://www.fundacionsol.cl/estudios/pensiones-por-la-fuerza-2019/).

* Historically Chile has been one of the most unequal countries in the world, challening Mexico for the sad last place in the ranking among OCDE counties [REF](https://data.oecd.org/chart/5Ivh).

* In the 2017 Human Development Index  Chile ranks 44th in the world, the 4th worse for OECD countries [REF](http://hdr.undp.org/en/data) [Resumen de Chile](http://hdr.undp.org/en/countries/profiles/CHL).

* In 2019 the wage for Chilean teachers is below the average for OECD countries [REF](https://data.oecd.org/teachers/teachers-salaries.htm), while Chile ranks among the 5 countries with the highest number of students per teacher [REF](https://data.oecd.org/chart/5IGj).

* In 2015 PISA tests Chile is on the third worse place in math [REF](https://data.oecd.org/chart/5IGk), 4th worse in science  [REF](https://data.oecd.org/chart/5IGm) and 5th worse in reading comprehension [REF](https://data.oecd.org/chart/5IKW), among the 35 OECD countries.

* In 2015 the results of the PISA tests in science are highly correlated with the student's socio-economic status, when compared against other countries. We rank 9th for the highest distance between rich and poor students [REF](http://gpseducation.oecd.org/CountryProfile?primaryCountry=CHL&treshold=10&topic=PI).

* In 2015 PISA tests show that Chileans schools have one the highest correlations between socio-economic status among students. That means that in the classroom students have basically the same socio-economic status. It can be also said that Chile is one of the countries with more social segretation in schools, ranking as one of the worse 3. [REF](http://gpseducation.oecd.org/CountryProfile?primaryCountry=CHL&treshold=10&topic=PI).
